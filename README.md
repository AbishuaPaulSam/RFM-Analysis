# RFM-GL


In ecommerce companies like online retails, customer segmentation is necessary in order to understand customers behaviors. It leverages aqcuired customer data like the one we have in our case, transactions data in order to divide customers into groups.

Our goal in this Notebook is to cluster our customers to get insights in:

Increasing revenue (Knowing customers who present most of our revenue)
Increasing customer retention
Discovering Trends and patterns
Defining customers at risk
We will do RFM Analysis as a first step and then combine RFM with predictive algorithms (k-means).

RFM Analysis answers these questions:

Who are our best customers?
Who has the potential to be converted in more profitable customers?
Which customers we must retain?
Which group of customers is most likely to respond to our current campaign?



The objective of the project is to help online retail store in customer retention, revenue and identify potential, proÔ¨Åtable, and lost customers by segregating based on their purchase history.


    
## Data
The dataset used in this project were obtained from Kaggle.


* The data was prepared and RFM Table was created.
* RFM scores were applied to each customer and customers were segmented based on RFM Scores.
* K-means algorithm was implemented.
